# Home Assistant Custom Icons for [matt8707](https://github.com/matt8707/hass-config) setup


* I created some animated Custom Icons for use in matt8707 configuration, all with the help of Matthias code
* The icons are a used of [elax46 custom-brand-icon pack](https://github.com/elax46/custom-brand-icons) and [Apples SF Symbols 4 pack](https://www.figma.com/file/cZS81qLCTeX7saMP4lfzl0/SF-Symbols-4.0---SVG-Icons-(Community)?type=design&node-id=5-1670&t=7F4MSwBO065lKuKU-0)
* There can be errors or un-logical parts in the code. I didn't learn programming. Help is appreciated
* There are two ways to install:
* Simple way: easy to install, a lot of work to modifiy later
* Difficult way: a bit more time to invest for install, easier to modifiy later
